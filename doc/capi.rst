C API Reference
===============

The Bangra C API can be used from within Bangra programs and as a C library, and is
defined in ``api.b`` and in the header part of ``bangra.cpp``. It is primarily
used to initialize the compiler / execution engine and to create new list trees.

This chapter will provide usage and reference information in a future release.
