Using Bang IR
=============

The Bang IR language closely mirrors most LLVM language features and is therefore
equivalent in features and function. Each IR expression aids in constructing
the declarations and definitions of a LLVM module. While functions are
constructed using the SSA form, Bang IR supports inlining of arguments where
possible. Bang IR also supports a few special expressions particular to Bang,
such as `include` and `run`.

This chapter will provide an overview and usage information for Bang IR in a
future release.
