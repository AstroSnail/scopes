Using Bangra IR
===============

The Bangra IR language closely mirrors most LLVM language features and is therefore
equivalent in features and function. Each IR expression aids in constructing
the declarations and definitions of a LLVM module. While functions are
constructed using the SSA form, Bangra IR supports inlining of arguments where
possible. Bangra IR also supports a few special expressions particular to Bangra,
such as :ir-special:`include`, :ir-special:`quote` and :ir-special:`execute`.

This chapter will provide an overview and usage information for Bangra IR in a
future release.
