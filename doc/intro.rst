Getting Started
===============

Installation
------------

You can either download a binary distribution of Bangra from the
`website <https://bitbucket.org/duangle/bangra>`_ or build Bangra from source.

How to build Bangra on Linux:

* You need build-essentials, clang 3.9, libclang 3.9 and LLVM 3.9 installed
* put ``clang++`` and ``llvm-config`` in your path OR extract the clang distro into
  the repo folder and rename it to ``clang``.
* You also need the latest source distribution of
  `libffi <https://sourceware.org/libffi/>`_.
* build libffi using `./configure --enable-shared=no --enable-static=yes && make` and
  softlink the generated build folder (e.g. `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`) as `libffi`
  in the repo folder.

* execute ``./makebangra``

How to build Bangra on Windows:

* Install `MSYS2 <http://msys2.github.io>`_ and
  `install <https://github.com/valtron/llvm-stuff/wiki/Build-LLVM-3.8-with-MSYS2>`_
  both llvm and clang 3.9 for ``x86_64``. The packages are named
  ``mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-llvm`` and ``mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-clang``.
* You also need to install the ``mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-libffi`` package.
* put ``clang++`` in your path OR make sure msys2 resides in ``C:\msys64`` OR edit
  ``makebangra.bat`` and change the path accordingly.
* copy ``libstdc++-6.dll``, ``libgcc_s_seh-1.dll``, ``libwinpthread-1.dll`` and
  ``libffi-6.dll`` from the msys2 installation into the repo folder.
  ``bangra.exe`` will depend on them.
* run ``makebangra.bat``

There should now be a ``bangra`` executable in your root folder.

Running
-------

To compile and execute a Bangra program, pass the source file as first argument
to the ``bangra`` compiler-interpreter::

    bangra <path-to-file.b>

Hello World
-----------

A simple "Hello World" program in Bangra IR looks as follows::

    IR

    # include C stdlib definitions
    include "../libc.b"

    # define global string constant and include
    # constant bitcast instruction
    defvalue hello-world
        bitcast
            global "" "hello world!\n"
            rawstring

    # our main function
    define main ()
        # the function type of this function
        function void

        # the first label is always the entry point
        label ""

            # call printf with argument hello-world
            call printf hello-world

            # return without argument
            ret;

    # run the main function
    run main
